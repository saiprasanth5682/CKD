# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model for the **early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**. By analyzing patient health records, the model can help in identifying potential CKD cases, enabling timely medical intervention.

## 📊 Project Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease affects millions worldwide, often going undetected until advanced stages. This project uses **classification techniques** to predict CKD based on key health indicators.

The notebooks included:
- **CKD.ipynb**: Data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **CKD_PCA.ipynb**: Dimensionality reduction using PCA and model retraining.
